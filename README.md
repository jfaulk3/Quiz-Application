# My Quiz Application

A mobile-first, responsive quiz application. Makes use of the trivia api found at https://opentdb.com/.
This project was created to increased familiarity with TypeScript and React. BootStraps is used to
handle the style of the application.

Users are presented with a page to pick their quiz settings. Upon starting the game, they will receive questions
based on the settings they chose when the application started.
